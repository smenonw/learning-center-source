## Overview

The planning is useful to look at teammates availability, allocate them for projects and check that you respect the budget quota.

You can plan a person by half-days: we think it's not worth planning by more fine-grained amounts of time. If your tasks require less time, just group them!

**You cannot plan people for the current day: if you don't know what you have to do when you arrive at the office, how can you be productive?**

**A project manager can plan other people on a project only if a budget exists for that project.**

## People Allocation

On the top you have three buttons, from the left:

* The **select project button** lets you search for a project and pick one from the list;

* The **filter people button** lets you filter the teammates you want to see in the planning;

* The **switch weeks button** lets you travel in time, you can see future and past weeks.

When you select a project, only the half-days allocated for that project will be highlighted, this allows you to have a general point of view on the teammates which are already on the project. Â For the same reason, selecting a project will sort people by showing first all those who were planned on the project at least once. Because is better to work with people that are aware of the challenge, right?

To know how many budget days you can allocate just look at the box that appears at the top of the page: here you can see all the days left, grouped by user level.

All your teammates are listed on the left, to allocate a person you just need to click on the half-day you want to assign. If you hold and drag your mouse, you can assign more half-days at once.

The **filter people button** lets you combine different filters, for example you may decide to see only the internal employees which are managers and have a background in design (you can use [tags]({{< relref "settings/index.md#team" >}}) to divide employees into categories).
