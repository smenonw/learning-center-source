## Overview

The planning has two section: **People Allocation** and **Projects' Heatmap**, the first one is useful to look at teammates availability, allocate them for projects and check that you respect the budget quota, the second section shows the project's daily 'weight' or, in simple words, how many people ore planned on a project each day, it also offers a 'milestone' system that allow your team to see an overview on the important scheduled events.

## People Allocation

On the top you have three buttons, from the left:

* The **select project button** lets you search for a project and pick one from the list;

* The **filter people button** lets you filter the teammates you want to see in the planning;

* The **switch weeks button** lets you travel in time, you can see future and past weeks.

When you select a project, only the half-days allocated for that project will be highlighted, this allows you to have a general point of view on the teammates which are already on the project. Â For the same reason, selecting a project will sort people by showing first all those who were planned on the project at least once. Because is better to work with people that are aware of the challenge, right?

To know how many budget days you can allocate just look at the box that appears at the top of the page: here you can see all the days left, grouped by user level.

All your teammates are listed on the left, to allocate a person you just need to click on the half-day you want to assign. If you hold and drag your mouse, you can assign more half-days at once.

You can plan a person by half-days: we think it's not worth planning by more fine-grained amounts of time. If your tasks require less time, just group them!

**You cannot plan people for the current day: if you don't know what you have to do when you arrive at the office, how can you be productive?**

**A project manager can plan other people on a project only if a budget exists for that project.**

The **filter people button** lets you combine different filters, for example you may decide to see only the internal employees which are managers and have a background in design (you can use \[tags\]({{< relref "settings/index.md#team" >}}) to divide employees into categories).

## Projects' Heatmap

The '**heatmap**' is a graph useful to show the 'hot' zone, in this case we are showing the 'weight' of the planned projects: the darker the color, the more people ore planned on the project that day. The colors range is splitted in 10 levels from white to blue, where the darkest blue represents the most planned people on a project in a day for the visible range of time.

There is a six weeks calendar, with a blue dot on today, you can move in the date range via horizontal scroll. On the left we have the client acronym, the project name and the color of the job order category the project is part of. You can search for a client or a job order category via the search field. You can also 'hide' a single project from the heatmap by clicking on the 'x' near the project name.

**The heatmap is always updated based on the visible projects and date range!**

You can see the details of which people are planned by clicking on a day, there you can also add '**events**': when in a day a lot of people are planned on the same project probably there is some sort of event like a meeting, a travel or a project is ending, if so, you can them on the heatmap in order to create a better overview on what is goin on in your company. This is also useful to avoid the overlapping of two or more important event that usually need a lot of resources.
