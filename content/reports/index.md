## Overview

All the data you insert in WETHOD are used to generate, weekly and automatically, a set of reports useful to monitoring the projects' progress.

## Project Report

Each Monday, utilising data provided by Project Status, Timesheet and Budget, a Project Report is automatically created.

## Budget Consumption

This is an overview of all Projects in terms of resources and time spent on the project, allowing you to analyse their health at a glance.

For each pipeline's project, its [budget consumption]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#budget-consumption" >}}) is compared to its [project status]({{< relref "friday/index.md#project-status" >}}) percentage:

* If the project is **above the diagonal**: it's using a lot of days but it's progressing slowly than predictions based on budget;

* If the project is **under the diagonal**: it's using few days but it's progressing faster than predictions based on budget;

* If the project is **on the diagonal**: it's planned and managed correctly.

Using filters, you can select the Projects you want to see and explore details such as billed hours, invoiced totals, and internal and external purchase orders.

## Revenue Progress

This compares the projects' status with the percentage of their value which is already been invoiced:

* If the project is **above the diagonal**: more work days than the actually done have been invoiced;

* If the project is **under the diagonal**: not al work days done for the project have been invoiced;

* If the project is **on the diagonal**: project status and invoiced percentage are consistent, this means that until now all the work days done has been invoiced.

## Revenue Pipeline

This report is composed by three sections which aggregate the [revenue pipeline]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#revenue-pipeline" >}}) **by probability**, **by client** or **by project type**.

Each section shows a column diagram, where each column refers to a particular year (previous, current, next) and its generated by the projects which invoice plan hits that year. Clicking on a column will show a right panel with further information linked to the column itself.

### By Probability

Each column is divided into subcolumns which group projects with different probability.

Clicking on a subcolumn will show a panel listing all the grouped projects with their:

* Name;

* Client's name;

* Value;

* Probability;

* [Expected value]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#expected-value" >}}).

### By Client

Clicking on a column will show a panel listing all the grouped projects with their:

* Client's name;

* Value;

* Percentage of influence on the [revenue pipeline]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#revenue-pipeline" >}}).

### By Project Type

Clicking on a column will show a panel listing all the grouped projects with their:

* Client's name;

* Value;

* Percentage of influence on the [revenue pipeline]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#revenue-pipeline" >}}).

## Revenue Actuals

<div><p>This report is composed by two sections which aggregate the already made invoices by month or by client.</p><p>Each section shows a column diagram, where each column refers to a particular year (previous, current, next) and its generated by the invoices made that year. Clicking on a column will show a right panel with further information linked to the column itself.</p></div>

### By Month

Clicking on a column will show a panel listing all the months for which an invoice exists with their:

* Name;
* Invoices' value sum for that month;
* Percentage of influence on the annual invoice amount.

### By Client

Clicking on a column will show a panel listing all the clients for which an invoice exists with their:

* Name;
* Invoices' value sum for that client;
* Percentage of influence on the annual invoice amount.

## Production Value

This is an overview of the annual projects' [production value]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#production-value" >}}. By clicking on a specific month you can access that month's production value grouped **by client**, **by project** or **by week**.

## Timesheets

This is a weekly overview of the [timesheets]({{< relref "friday/index.md#timesheet" >}}) made by your teammates, each timesheet is coloured as the [job order category]({{< relref "settings/index.md#company" >}}) of the project it's linked to and you can see the project's name by clicking on its timesheet.

On the top left corner you can filter the displayed people.

On the top right corner you can change the week of the displayed timesheets.

## Changelog

Here are listed all the changes done on value or probability of pipeline's projects. For each change you can see:

* The name of the project which has been changed;
* The name of the change's author;
* The change's date;
* The old value and the updated value;
* The old probability and the updated probability;
* The difference between the updated and the old [expected value]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#expected-value" >}}).
