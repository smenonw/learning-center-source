## Overview

All the data you insert in WETHOD are used to generate, weekly and automatically, a set of reports useful to monitoring the projects' progress.

## Project Report

Each Monday, utilising data provided by Project Status, Timesheet and Budget, a Project Report is automatically created.

## Budget Consumption

This is an overview of all Projects in terms of resources and time spent on the project, allowing you to analyse their health at a glance.

For each pipeline's project, its [budget consumption]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#budget-consumption" >}}) is compared to it [project status]({{< relref "friday/index.md#project-status" >}}) percentage:

* If the project is **above the diagonal**: it's using a lot of days but it's progressing slowly than predictions based on budget;
* If the project is **under the diagonal**: it's using few days but it's progressing faster than predictions based on budget;
* If the project is **on the diagonal**: it's planned and managed correctly.

Using filters, you can select the Projects you want to see and explore details such as billed hours, invoiced totals, and internal and external purchase orders.

## Revenue Progress

This compares the projects' status with the percentage of their value which is already been invoiced:

* If the project is **above the diagonal**: more work days than the actually done have been invoiced;
* If the project is **under the diagonal**: not al work days done for the project have been invoiced;
* If the project is **on the diagonal**: project status and invoiced percentage are consistent, this means that until now all the work days done has been invoiced.
