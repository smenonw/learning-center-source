## Overview

All the data you insert in WETHOD are used to generate, weekly and automatically, a set of reports useful to monitoring the projects' progress.

## Project Report

Each Monday, utilising data provided by Project Status, Timesheet and Budget, a Project Report is automatically created.

## Budget Consumption

This is an overview of all Projects in terms of resources and time spent on the project, allowing you to analyse their health at a glance.

For each pipeline's project, its [budget consumption]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#budget-consumption" >}}) is compared to its [project status]({{< relref "friday/index.md#project-status" >}}) percentage:

* If the project is **above the diagonal**: it's using a lot of days but it's progressing slowly than predictions based on budget;

* If the project is **under the diagonal**: it's using few days but it's progressing faster than predictions based on budget;

* If the project is **on the diagonal**: it's planned and managed correctly.

Using filters, you can select the Projects you want to see and explore details such as billed hours, invoiced totals, and internal and external purchase orders.

## Revenue Progress

This compares the projects' status with the percentage of their value which is already been invoiced:

* If the project is **above the diagonal**: more work days than the actually done have been invoiced;

* If the project is **under the diagonal**: not al work days done for the project have been invoiced;

* If the project is **on the diagonal**: project status and invoiced percentage are consistent, this means that until now all the work days done has been invoiced.

## Revenue Pipeline

This report is composed by three sections which aggregate the [revenue pipeline]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#revenue-pipeline" >}}) **by probability**, **by client** or **by project type**.

Each section shows a column diagram, where each column refers to a particular year (previous, current, next) and its generated by the projects invoiced during that year. Clicking on a column will show a right panel with further information linked to the column itself.

### By Probability

Each column is divided into subcolumns which group projects with different probability.

Clicking on a subcolumn will show a panel listing all the grouped projects with their:

* Name;
* Client's name;
* Value;
* Probability;
* [Expected value]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#expected-value" >}}).

### By Client

Clicking on a column will show a panel listing all the grouped projects with their:

* Client's name;
* Value;
* Percentage of influence on the [revenue pipeline]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#revenue-pipeline" >}}).

### By Project Type

Clicking on a column will show a panel listing all the grouped projects with their:

* Client's name;
* Value;
* Percentage of influence on the [revenue pipeline]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#revenue-pipeline" >}}).

## Production Value

This is an overview of the annual projects' [production value]({{< relref "glossary/index.md#production-value" >}}. By clicking on a specific month you can access that month's production value grouped **by client**, **by project** or **by week**.
