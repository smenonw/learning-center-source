## Overview

From here you can see the orders' amount grouped by projects.

Each row in this view represents a project and carries with it a bunch of information:

* Name and client for the project
* The monthly distribution for the current year: for each month you can appreciate the planned orders' amount and the approved orders amount (colored with lower opacity)
* The total planned amount for the current year

If your company activated the [multicurrency functionality]({{< relref "finance/index.md#currency" >}}), you can see all the currencies used for a project's orders by clicking on that project's row.

{{< note title="Note" >}}
**Planned orders are those which have been sent or created, but not approved yet.**
