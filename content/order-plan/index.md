## Overview

From here you can see the orders' amount grouped by projects.

Each row in this view represents a project and carries with it the following information:

* Name, PM and client for the project
* The monthly distribution for the current year
* For each month you can see the planned orders' amount and the approved orders amount (coloured in grey or in red if lower than planned)
* The total planned amount for the current year

{{< note title="Note" >}} **Planned orders are those which have been sent or created, but not approved yet.** {{< /note >}}

If your company activated the [multicurrency functionality]({{< relref "finance/index.md#currency" >}}), you can see all the currencies used for a project's orders by clicking on that project's row.

If the period of supply lasts more than the project's length, you will still be able to see it in the **Company Order Plan**.

If the period of supply ends in a different year than the current one, you will be able to see it by clicking on the year selector.
