## Overview

Here you can see the details about [Profit & Loss]({{< relref "profit-loss/index.md" >}})' gross margin for each month of the current year.

For each month, a project's gross margin is the difference between its [revenues]({{< relref revenues/index.md" >}}) and its [external costs]({{< relref "external-costs/index.md" >}}).

Three important indicators are given in the first rows:

* **Total**: the sum of all your projects' gross margin, per month

* **Bluesky**: the dfference between [revenues]({{< relref revenues/index.md" >}})'s bluesky and [external costs]({{< relref "external-costs/index.md" >}})' bluesky

* **Delta revenues target**: the dfference between [revenues]({{< relref revenues/index.md" >}})'s delta revenues target and [external costs]({{< relref "external-costs/index.md" >}})' delta revenues target
