## Overview

## Timesheet

At the end of each week, type in the actual hours you've spent working on the Projects you are involved in under Friday menu.

The Timesheet section records data which will be used to determine the actual Budget consumption in terms of work hours for each Project. It's all really easy, fast and simple.

Timesheets will never be the same again.

## Project Status

Once the weekend is near, each PM estimates the days left to finish the project and inserts this number in the Project Status.
