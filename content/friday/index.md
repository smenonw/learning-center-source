## Overview

WETHOD follows a weekly cycle: we think that a week is a good trade-off between the need to control the project's progress as much as possible and the need to not burden the control activities.

## Timesheet

At the end of each week, type in here the actual hours you've spent working on the projects you are involved in.Â It's all really easy, fast and simple.

The data inserted here will be used to determine the actual [budget consumption]({{< relref "reports/index.md#budget-consumption" >}}) in terms of work hours for each project.

## Project Status

At the end of each week, the PM estimates the days left to finish the project and inserts this number here.
