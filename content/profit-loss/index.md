Below, you can see how much your company has earned or has lost during each month of the current year.

This data is obtained by subtracting from the [revenues](http://support.wethod.com/revenues/index/#) of all the costs faced by the company. The costs can be of various kinds:

* [External costs](http://support.wethod.com/external-costs/index/#)

* [Payroll](http://support.wethod.com/payroll/index/#)

* [G & A](http://support.wethod.com/general-admin/index/#)

* [Marketing](http://support.wethod.com/marketing/index/#)

* [CapEx](http://support.wethod.com/capex/index/)

We provide you with two *subtotal* in order to better understand the final value of profit & loss for the company:

* **Gross margin**: revenues without the external costs;

* **Net margin**: gross margin without payroll.

**A number in parenthesis represents a cost which is being subtracted from the number right above it.**

**All the numbers here are provided in thousands (K).**
