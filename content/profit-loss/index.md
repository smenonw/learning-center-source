## Overview

This page provides an overview of the budgetary slippages between a company's projected revenues and  its expenses, as well as its budget target over a given period of time. The three columns **budget**, **forecast 1** and **forecast 2** can be used to set the company's financial goals for each quarter of the year. 

The column **budget** in the **revenues** row is used to set the revenues' target for the company, which is used in the widget [Revenue Clock]({{< relref "dashboard/index.md#revenue-clock" >}}) and in the report [Production Value]({{< relref "reports/index.md#production-value" >}}).

Below, you can see how much your company has earned or has lost during each month of the current year.

This data is obtained by subtracting from the [revenues](http://support.wethod.com/revenues/index/#) of all the costs faced by the company. The costs can be of various kinds:

* [External costs](http://support.wethod.com/external-costs/index/#)

* [Payroll](http://support.wethod.com/payroll/index/#)

* [G & A](http://support.wethod.com/general-admin/index/#)

* [Marketing](http://support.wethod.com/marketing/index/#)

* [CapEx](http://support.wethod.com/capex/index/)

We provide you with two *subtotal* in order to better understand the final value of profit & loss for the company:

* **Gross margin**: revenues without the external costs;

* **Net margin**: gross margin without payroll.
