## Overview

This section shows you the Revenues that your company have minus all the costs distributed per mont.

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The result is the Profit &amp; Loss that&nbsp;helps you understanding how much you effectively earned and how your business is going on.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">On the middle you have:</span>

* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">the </span>**Gross Margin**<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> (Revenues - External Costs) and also the Total Gross Margin per year.</span>

* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;the </span>**Net Margin**<span style="font-size: 1rem;"> (Gross Margin - Payroll) and also the Total Net Margin per year.</span>

Notice that **Profit & Loss** (Net Margin - G&A and Marketing) is the Net Margin minus the G&A and Marketing Costs of your business both listed above.

You cannot add or modify data here, you have to do it in the specific section of the voice that you are changing.

{{< note title="Note" >}} When a number is between parenthesis ( ), it means that is a cost that we are subtracting from our revenues. {{< /note >}}
