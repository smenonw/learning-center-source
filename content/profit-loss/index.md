## Overview

Here you can see how much your company has earned or has lost during each month of the current year, the "Profit & Loss" row shows you this piece of information.  

This data is obtained by subtracting from the [revenues](http://support.wethod.com/revenues/index/#) all the costs faced by the company. The costs can be of various kinds: 

*	[External costs](http://support.wethod.com/external-costs/index/#)
*	[Payroll](http://support.wethod.com/payroll/index/#)
*	[G & A](http://support.wethod.com/general-admin/index/#)
*	[Marketing](http://support.wethod.com/marketing/index/#)

We provide you with two *subtotal* in order to better undertand the final value of profit & loss for the compamny:

* **Gross margin**:Â revenues without the external costs;

* **Net margin**: gross margin without payroll.
