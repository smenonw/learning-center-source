## Overview

This section shows the [Revenues](http://support.wethod.com/revenues/index/#) of your company, yearly and by month, considering all the costs.

The result is the **Profit & Loss** that helps you understand how much you effectively earned and how your business is going on.

We have:

* **Gross Margin** ([Revenues](http://support.wethod.com/revenues/index/#) - [External Costs](http://support.wethod.com/external-costs/index/#)) and also the Total Gross Margin per year.

* **Net Margin** (Gross Margin - [Payroll](http://support.wethod.com/payroll/index/#)) and also the Total Net Margin per year.
* **Profit & Loss** (Net Margin - [G&A](http://support.wethod.com/general-admin/index/#) - [Marketing](http://support.wethod.com/marketing/index/#)) both by year and monthly.

You cannot add or modify data here, you have to do it in the specific section of the voice that you are changing.

{{< note title="Note" >}} When a number is between parenthesis ( ), it means that is a cost that we are subtracting from our revenues.
Remember that all the values are indicated in thousand (k). {{< /note >}}
