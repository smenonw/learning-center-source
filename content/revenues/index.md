Revenue is the amount of money that a company actually receives during a specific year, it is calculated by multiplying the price at which goods or services are sold by the number of units or amount sold.

In this section the projects of the Pipeline considering their probability and duration are listed showing the value they have per month.

The Value which is the sum of the present values of all the projects per month and year.

Over the Value there is what we call the Bluesky which represents the hypothetical value that a project will have, it is decided by the Owner or by the users that have the permissions.

The Total will show automatically the projection of how will be the value of the projects if everything goes as you expect. Of course if the overall Bluesky is 0, then the Total will be equal to the reported Value.

Notice that the PM is able to decide how to distribute the Invoice Plan (http://support.wethod.com/pipeline/index/#invoice-plan) of the projects along the months. If the distribution is set to AUTO, the Invoice Plan will be distributed equally among all months.

On the other hand if it is MANUAL, the PM will have to decide it.

As for Profit & Loss here you cannot change but just visualize the data of Revenues, with the exception of the Bluesky that you can modify in every moment.
