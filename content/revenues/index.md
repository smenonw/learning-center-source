## Overview

Revenues per year are the sum of the values of the projects in the Pipeline distributed among the months according to their probability and considering the Invoice Plan. 

In this section the projects of the Pipeline considering their probability and duration are listed showing the value they have per month.

The **Value** which is the sum of the present values of all the projects per month and year.

Over the Value there is what we call the **[Bluesky](http://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#bluesky)** which represents the hypothetical value that a project will have, it is decided by the Owner or by the users that have the permissions.

The **Total** will show automatically the projection of how will be the value of the projects if everything goes as you expect. Of course if the overall Bluesky is 0, then the Total will be equal to the reported Value.

Notice that the PM is able to decide how to distribute the [Invoice Plan](http://support.wethod.com/pipeline/index/#invoice-plan) of the projects along the months. If the distribution is set to *AUTO*, the Invoice Plan will be distributed equally among all months.

On the other hand if it is *MANUAL*, the PM will have to decide it.

As for Profit & Loss here you cannot change but just visualize the data of Revenues, with the exception of the [Bluesky](http://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#bluesky) that you can modify in every moment.
