## Overview

Here you can see the value of your [projects](http://support.wethod.com/pipeline/index/#projects) for each month of the current year. 

The monthly distribution is achieved by looking at the [invoice plan](http://support.wethod.com/pipeline/index/#invoice-plan) of every project, for example: if a project is evaluated 10 K with 3 K planned to be invoiced in January and 7 K planned to be invoiced in February, the value of this project will contribute with 3 K to the January's revenues and with 7 K to February's revenues.  

Three important indicators are given in the first three rows:

*	**Total**: the sum of all your projects' revenues, per month;
*	**[Bluesky](http://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#bluesky)**: here you can insert, for each month, the value (in K) you think is missing from the total to reach the expected revenues. For example: January's total is 2 K but you're sure you will invoice 5 K in the same month by the end of the year, just add a Bluesky of 3 K to adjust your revenues;
*	**Revenues**: revenues without bluesky, per month.
