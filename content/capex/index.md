## Overview

Here you can see the value of your [Capex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure) by project. To mark all costs in a project as Capex, just assign that project a [job order category](http://support.wethod.com/settings/index/#company) where "Capex" is flagged

Total Capex costs for a prooject are divided into:
*	**Payroll costs**: all the costs derived from employees' levels' rates
*	**External costs**

You can edit the *Capex percentage* field to tell Wethod the real ratio between costs and capex for a project.
