## Overview

Here you can see the external costs listed in your projects' [budget](http://support.wethod.com/budget/index/) for each month of the current year.

The monthly distribution is achieved by looking at the [production plan](http://support.wethod.com/finance/index/#production-plan) of every project, for example: if a project has a value of 10 K with 3 K planned to be produced in January and 7 K planned to be produced in February, we can also say that you planned to invoice 30% in January and 70% in February. So the external costs  of this project will contribute by 30% to the January's external costs and by 70% to February's external costs.

Three important indicators are given in the first three rows:

* **Total**: the sum of all your projects' external costs, per month;

* **[Bluesky](http://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#bluesky)**: here you can insert only one percentage. This indicates, for each month of the current year, the percentage of that month's revenues' bluesky to see as external costs' bluesky. If you know that, for your projects, the external costs are always around the 25% of the project's revenues so you can insert 25% in the External Costs' bluesky. This way the 25% of the Revenues' bluesky will be added as External Costs' bluesky, helping balancing [Profit & Loss](http://support.wethod.com/profit-loss/index/). For example: if January's revenues' bluesky is 4 K and external costs' bluesky is 25%, then a 1 K external costs' bluesky will be automatically added to January;

* **Values**: external costs without bluesky, per month.
