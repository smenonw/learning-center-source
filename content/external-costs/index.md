## Overview

The External Costs are all the indirect costs that you have to consider in your business. They are listed on the Budget and distributed among the months considering the Invoice Â Plan.

In this section all the external costs of all the projects are listed per month and year.

Notice that here **[Bluesky](http://support.wethod.com/glossary/index/#bluesky)** is not shown month per month but is represented as the percentage of the Bluesky of Revenues for every month.

The External Costs table can only be visualized and not directly modified.
