The External Costs are all the indirect costs that you have to consider in your business.

In this section all the external costs of all the projects are listed per month and year.

Notice that here **Bluesky** is not shown month per month but is represented by an unic percentage on the Revenuesâ€™ Bluesky.

The External Costs table can only be visualized and not directly modified.
