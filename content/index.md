## What It Is

WETHOD is the online tool to manage people and projects in a collaborative way. We aim to make the project management simple, distributing the responsibilities among all the team members and reducing stress derived from projects organization.

The result is a deeply integrated system that manages all the information which are essential for a project-oriented company: budget, planning, timesheet and activity report.

This enables WETHOD to create a system where everybody collaborate and keep information up to date, a system that rewards who done well and warns the others.

## What It Needs

Just few elements are needed in order to get things working:

* A project budget;

* The weekly [timesheet]({{< relref "friday/index.md#timesheet" >}});

* The weekly [project status]({{< relref "friday/index.md#project-status" >}}).

**The responsibility of updating each of these elements is shared among all the team members, avoiding any unnecessary administrative burden.**
