## Overview

Let's create our first content file for your documenion. Open a terminal and add the following command for each new file you want to add. Replace `section-name`Â with a general term that describes your document in detail.

```
hugo new section-name/filename.md

```

Visitors of your website will find the final document under `www.example.com/&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;section-name&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;/filename/`.

Since it's possible to have multiple content files in the same section I recommend to create at least one `index.md` file per section. This ensures that users will find an index page under `www.example.com/section-name`.

## Widgets

Add a new widget to your dashboard is so easy: just click on the "**+**" and pick one from the list of the available widgets.
