## Overview

Here's the list of all your employees' salary for the current year. 

Each *Employee* has at least a **segment** which represents a work contract between that employee and the company. Every segment has:

* **Start month**
* **End month**
* **Gross monthly salary**
* **Taxes**

You can access the segments for a specific employee just by clicking on the employee'row. Each time you edit a list of segments, this influences the employee's *salary distribution*: a line where all segments are visually represented, allowing you to quickly understand how many times the salary of an employee is changed during the year.   

In the **Placeholders** section you can see how new employees will impact your business: just add new fake salaries and see if your revenues are still healthy.

**Each Placeholder has at least a segment, if you delete the last segment the relative placeholder will be deleted.**

**It is not possible to delete the last segment of an Employee.**

**It is not possible to save a new segment until you fill all the required fields.**
