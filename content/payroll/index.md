## Overview

Payroll is the section where you can find the list of all your employees and their salaries.

It is useful because it shows how much it cost an employee in the yearâ€™s months, in order to obtain the **Gross Margin**.

Here you also add how much **Taxes** you pay for each employee you have.

Through the **Segment** the PM or the Owner is able to modify the salary of an employee that maybe have reached a promotion during the year. (Segment shows you a graphical and colored representation of how much an employee have earned from a starting date to the ending one during the year)

Furthermore the **Placeholders** helps you to take into consideration salaries of employees that you will have to pay but that you have not hired yet.

Placeholders show you the impact of new employments on your revenues.

{{< note title="Note" >}} Notice that the Placeholder is already created with a Segment on it. It is not possible to delete the last Segment of an employee to cancel a Placeholder, but you can of course modify it.

What's more it is not possible to save a Segment until you complete all the fill gaps which are: Start, End, Monthly and Taxes.
