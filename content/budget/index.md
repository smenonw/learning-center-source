## Overview

The budget is the total amount of resources needed by a project, either internal and external costs. Internal costs are the working days you need to end the project, the external costs are theÂ expenses you need to take.

Choose the project in the projects pipeline by clicking on it and use the 'Budget' button to enter the budget creation mode. Here you can define the budget structure: choose the default areas or create a budget from a previously saved template (see budget creation for more info).

A budget is composed by areas and tasks: an area is a task container, a task is an activity that has some days of work or some external cost or both of them. You can add new areas by using the '+ area' button: you can choose a default area or you can create a new one by typing the name.
