## Overview

The budget is where you can list all the resources you think you'll need for the project.

{{< img-center src="/uploads/2017/08/28/budget-giftop.gif">}}

Basically, this is the place where you define (for a project):

* How many people you need;
* Which experience levels you need;
* Which tasks are needed to get the job done;
* Who will do what;
* The external costs;
* The selling price.

Done? Now the budget must be approved by a supervisor and, once approved, the project manager can start [planning]({{< relref "planning/index.md" >}}) and creating [orders]({{< relref "finance/index.md#orders" >}}).

When a project reach 50% of probability, it's a good practice to make a budget for it.

## The Structure

The budget section is composed by three main parts: project details, price details and the budget editor.

### **Project details**

Positioned in the top left, this part shows project information details such as the client, project name, project type, PM name, duration and probability. In this section, you can also:

* see the **budget consumption/project status graph**
* add **notes**

### **Price Details**

Positioned in the top right, this part shows some details about the project’s price:

* **Suggested net price**: the price we think is good to sell your project, calculated by the costs;
* **Final net price**: regardless of the suggested net price, you can decide on your own what you think is the best price for the project;
* **Margin**: the difference between suggested net price and the costs;
* **Contingency**: life is unpredictable and the unexpected is behind every corner, so why not be prepared for it? A percentage of contingency means that you know your budget isn’t perfect so you’re estimating using more days, just in case. The contingency gives you more days which you can use at every user level but, on the other hand, the suggested net price will grow;
* **Discount**: the percentage of discount you want to apply to the suggested price;

### Budget editor

This is basically a table where you can assign days to a given user level of a _task_. A _task_ is a macro activity needed to complete the project, related tasks can be grouped into _areas_.

You can add new _areas_ by using the "**+ AREA**" button: type in a meaningful name and hit enter.

For each external cost you can assign a **markup**: a percentage that indicates how much you want to earn on that external cost.

Positioned on the top of this section you can find the sum of the values for each column.

The first columns of the budget show how many work days you need for each _user level_:

* **Ext. Cost**: shows the sum of the external costs
* **Days**: the total amount of days
* **Cost**: the sum of the budget’s days multiplied by the cost of the user level that will take care of it. This value is also called _internal costs_
* **Price**: the suggested price we think is optimal to sell your project

## The Workflow

1. Select a project from the [Pipeline](/pipeline/index/) and click on its budget button;
2. Compile the budget;
3. Submit the budget for approval by clicking on the top left button "**submit for approval**";
4. When the budget is approved by a supervisor, you will be able to [plan](/planning/index/) some resource on the project and start working on it;
5. Whenever you need to modify the budget, you can set it back to draft and restart from point 
3. Each time a new budget version is approved, it's saved and you can access it through the dropdown list under the Price's Detail panel.

When a budget is submitted, a supervisor can appreciate all the changes by looking at the orange labels. This makes the approval process easier and faster.

Not sure if a budget’s area will fit? Just switch it off! 
**Switching off an area** will remove it from the budget estimate. You can always switch an area back at a later date whenever you wish.

Want to see the difference between two approved budget versions? Hit the **Compare versions** button and select the two versions you want to compare. Use the Clear button to compare between two other versions and click Close to end the comparisons.
