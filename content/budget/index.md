## Overview

When the project has enough probability to start  you can add a budget: the total resources available for the project, as internal and external costs. Choose the project in the [projects pipeline](http://support.wethod.com/pipeline/index/#projects) by clicking on it and use the 'Budget' button to enter the budget creation mode. Here you can define the budget structure: choose the default areas or create a budget from a previously saved template (see [budget creation](http://support.wethod.com/budget/index/#budget-creation) for more info).

A budget is composed by areas and tasks: an area is a task container, a task is an activity that has some days of work or some external cost or both of them. You can add new areas by using the '+ area' button: you can choose a default area or you can create a new one by typing the name.
