## Overview

Everything starts from Pipeline, here is where opportunities and projects are listed, both of them are defined by a small amount of significant information:

* Name;

* Client;

* Value (in €k);

* Percentage of external costs;

* Category;

* Probability.

Pipeline has three subsections: Basket, Projects and Programs.

## Basket

<div><p>The Basket contains all the project’s opportunity that are not well-defined yet. You can see it as a place where to put all the ideas that you usually write on a notebook or on a Post-It.</p><p>The significant information listed above are <i>not mandatory</i> for an opportunity.</p><p><b>Opportunities usually have a probability between 1% and 99%.</b></p></div>

## Projects

<div><p>An opportunity evolves into a Project when things get serious, in order to take this step you must have an idea about the significant information listed above.</p><p>A Project can furthermore have an invoice plan and a budget.</p>
	<p>
		A project is considered <b>active</b> when its probability reaches 90%, only when this happens makes sense to plan people or to do timeheets for this project.
	</p>
	<p><b>Billable Projects must have a probability of 100%.</b></p>
<p><b>When a project status reach 0, it's a good practice to archive it.</b></p>
<p><b>When a project reach 50% of probability, it's a good practice to make a budget for it.</b></p></div>

## Programs

Projects are often stages or parts of something bigger, you can use a Program to group together different projects in order to see their aggregate [economic reports]({{< relref "reports/index.md#economics" >}}).
