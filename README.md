# learning-center-source
Here you can find all the files __needed to build__ the site "WETHOD Learning Center". 
## Details
* The site is statically generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/);
* The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at https://wethod.github.io;
* If you need a visual editor and/or a simple CMS, you can use [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io);
* The served files are in [another repo](https://github.com/wethod/wethod.github.io). We need to mantain different repositories for source code and served files because of how Forestry.io works.
