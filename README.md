# learning-center-source
Here you can find all the files needed to build the site "WETHOD Learning Center". 
## Details
* The site is statically generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/);
* The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/);
* If you need a visual editor, you can use [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io);
